# basic-onlinevotingsystem



This online voting system was designed by Sathi Raja Sekhar Reddy and Chirla Satya Deleep Reddy using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionalities. It serves as a basic example or application of a voting system.

The webpage first checks whether a user is eligible to vote. If eligible, the user can select a participant's symbol and cast their vote. Otherwise, an error message is displayed indicating that they are not eligible to vote.
